Search for Dark Matter Produced in Association with Hadronically Decaying Bosons at √s = 13 TeV with the ATLAS Detector at the LHC

My thesis discusses searches for particle dark matter produced in association with hadronically decaying particles using the ATLAS Run-2 proton-proton collision data at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).

Although the Standard Model of particle physics provides a comprehensive description of nature at the smallest scale in excellent agreement with measurement, the theory does not account for over 80% of the universe’s gravitating matter – the non-luminous dark matter.
Searches for new physics at the LHC can probe signatures of yet unobserved dark matter particles. If dark matter particles are produced in collision events, they can only be detected by their recoil on visible particles in signatures with missing transverse momentum.

The three searches described in my thesis probe dark matter production using heavy bosons in their hadronic decay mode, as it is the most prevalent and thus best suited for discovery.
They explore signatures with hadronically decaying vector bosons, Higgs bosons decaying to b-quarks, and hypothetical dark Higgs bosons decaying to pairs of vector bosons. The searches pioneered analysis techniques for b-quark identification, background suppression, and boosted object reconstruction. In all searches, the background was estimated using predictions from MC simulation with corrections from control regions for dominant background processes.
No significant deviations from the Standard Model background were observed. The interpretation of the results constrains the viable parameters of models describing dark matter production.

The search for dark matter produced in association with a hadronically decaying vector boson is based on the proton-proton collision data recorded by the ATLAS detector in the years 2015 and 2016. The analysis employed vector boson candidate jet reconstruction techniques in resolved and boosted event topologies, enhanced by jet substructure information and multivariate algorithms to identify jets from the vector boson decay containing b-hadrons. The results were interpreted in terms of limits on a simplified dark matter model, invisible decays of Higgs bosons into dark matter particles, and generic upper limits on W/Z-boson and dark matter production. The results are published in Ref. 1 and set limits on the parameters of a spin-1 Z' simplified model, excluding Z' mediator masses of up to 830 GeV for dark matter masses up to 280 GeV at 95 % confidence level for mediator couplings to quarks of 0.25 and dark matter particles of 1. Further, the results were included in Ref. 2, an extensive summary publication, for which I coordinated their integration and statistical interpretation in terms of a model for dark matter production with an extended Higgs sector, and in Ref. 3, a combination of ATLAS searches for invisible Higgs decays.

The search for dark matter produced in association with a Higgs boson decaying to b-quarks is based on the proton-proton collision data recorded by the ATLAS detector in the years 2015–2017. The Higgs boson candidates were reconstructed both in resolved and boosted topologies. For the first time in an ATLAS search, the variable-radius track jet method for the identification of jets originating from b-quarks in strongly boosted topologies was employed.
Conventionally, boosted objects decaying to b-quarks are reconstructed as a jet with large parameter. The two-pronged b-decay inside of the large-radius jet is identified with small-radius jets built from inner detector tracks due to their supreme spatial resolution. Building these track-jets with a variable radius parameter dependent on the jet transverse momentum enhances the sensitivity of the search by a factor of 3. Moreover, a new missing transverse momentum significance definition, which takes into account individual resolutions and correlations of all objects used in calculating the missing transverse momentum, was employed to strongly suppress the QCD multi-jet background. The results were made public in Ref. 4 and set limits on a Z'-2HDM simplified model, excluding masses of the Z′ boson up to 2.85 TeV at 95 % confidence level for a specific choice of the model parameters.

The search for dark matter produced in association with a hypothetical dark Higgs boson decaying to hadronically decaying vector bosons is based on the full ATLAS Run-2 proton-proton collision data. It is the first search at the LHC investigating the signature of missing transverse momentum and a resonantly produced vector boson pair. The analysis targets boosted and intermediate event topologies, using the novel track-assisted reclustering (TAR) jet algorithm for the first time in an ATLAS search. It combines re-clustered small-radius jets and precision substructure information computed from matched inner detector tracks. The use of TAR jets allows for the reconstruction of the vector boson pair four-prong hadronic decay in highly boosted final states. The results are published in Ref. 5 and constrain the parameters of a simplified model with spin-1 Z′ boson and spin-0 dark Higgs boson mediators, excluding dark Higgs boson masses of up to 230 GeV and Z′ boson masses of up to 1.8 TeV at 95 % confidence level for a specific choice of the other model parameters. This search has initiated further exploration of signatures in the dark-Higgs boson paradigm by ATLAS (Refs. 6,7) and CMS (Ref. 8).

In addition to the searches for dark matter, a study about the optimisation of the first-level ATLAS muon trigger is presented in my thesis. The trigger coincidence logic was optimised using the tag-and-probe based on muon pairs originating from the J/ψ psi resonance. The improved coincidence logic has been deployed for 2018 data-taking and enables a reduction of the trigger rate in the forward region of the detector while maintaining a high trigger efficiency.  

Searches for new physics represent a significant investment of time and resources. Existing searches for new phenomena often are sensitive to a larger class of new physics theory models. The RECAST framework enables the semi-automated reuse of background estimates, systematic uncertainties, and observed data from preserved searches to test alternative signal hypotheses. I coordinated and co-edited the first ATLAS public result using the RECAST reinterpretation framework. It was published in Ref. 9 and set constraints on a model predicting dark matter production in association with a dark Higgs boson decaying to b-quarks. The analysis preservation strategies employed by RECAST have become an integral part of the preservation of full Run-2 ATLAS searches for dark matter and other Beyond-the-Standard-Model phenomena.

In conclusion, my thesis presents three searches for dark matter in final states with missing transverse momentum and hadronically decaying heavy bosons. It discusses the significance of their results in the larger context of searches for dark matter at collider experiments and shows how their impact can be increased with the RECAST reinterpretation framework towards an increasing number of scenarios for phenomena beyond the Standard Model.
